# 🌌 Solar System Animation using Skyfield

**Visualize the Solar System in Motion 🌍🪐🌞**

This project animates the orbital positions of the planets in our Solar System using real astronomical data via [Skyfield](https://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/). It simulates planetary motion for a a specified range of timeand renders a beautiful 2D visualization with a space-themed aesthetic.
